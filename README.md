It's recommended to open the project in an IDE which has support for ediditing Jupyter notebooks.
This is e.g. [*VSCode*](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [*Theia*](https://theia-ide.org/) or [*PyCharm*](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) Professional (the Community version has read only support for notebooks ony).

Create venv: `python3 -m venv venv`

Activate venv: `source venv/bin/activate`

Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Open the Jupyter notebook file correpsonding to a design pattern in the IDE.

*Optional, but highly recommended:* Install *DB Browser for SQLite* from the [official download page](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)
